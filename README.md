# Wireframe

Given a screenshot of a website layout (wireframe.jpg) I just made a recreation of it. I used HTML5 in order to get the semantics as
correct as possible so that web crawlers can accurately pick out the important bits of the page. But, because the screenshot was all in
dummy text, I had to make guesses as to what was really important.
